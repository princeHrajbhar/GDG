## ðŸŒ¾ Why AgiTech?

The agricultural sector globally faces significant challenges:

- **Climate unpredictability:** Irregular rainfall and temperature fluctuations.
- **Crop diseases:** Undetected diseases causing massive yield losses.
- **Soil degradation:** Mismanagement of soil nutrients and water.
- **Market access:** Farmers lack real-time market demand and pricing data.
- **Lack of modern tech adoption:** Limited awareness of AI and data-driven tools.

AgiTech addresses these pain points with AI-powered decision-making, real-time analytics, and predictive modeling tailored for agricultural applications.
